          <h3>About the CEO – Mr. Dominic Amoako</h3>
          <p className="margin_0">
            I’m Dominic Amoako, a retired U.S. Army veteran whose life has been shaped by discipline, leadership, and service. With experience in regions like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, I’ve led operations in some of the most complex environments on earth.
            <br /><br />
            My roles in electronic systems and security have taught me to lead with calm, protect what matters, and ensure operational excellence under pressure. I hold certifications in Project Management (PMP), Security+, and Six Sigma Green Belt—each helping me continue that mission beyond the military.
            <br /><br />
            As CEO, I lead with integrity and service. My goal is always to create secure, peaceful spaces where people feel safe and valued.
